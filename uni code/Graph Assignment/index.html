				<p class="p-example">This assignment we were asked to produce data displayed in a visual form. <br> I produced a bar graph to display the popularity of each sport. This graph is to show which sport is the most popular among high school student.<br> To produce this graph i first found a template online to help me set out the code correctly.<br> Following the template as a guide i was able to repoduce the table with all the correct data displaying.<br>On the graph each sport has it's own bar with a good amount of space between the bars, the space is there to allow the graph to be easily read.<br>The bars are coloured in black and are against a white background, again this is so then the bars are easy to see.<br>The numbers down the left hand side of the graph are there to represent the number of people. They start at zero and go up to fourteen hundred.<br>Even though the graph is basic i feel it is effective in displaying the data, it is clear and easy to read.<br><br>Looking back over the assignment i feel it went quite well.<br>I was able to produce a graph and even though it is only a basic graph i am happy with how it turned out.<br>If i was to do anything differently, i would take more time to create a more interesting graph that has more colour and even an animation.<br>However i am happy with what i was able to produce. </p>
